I have one such habit of attending some interviews to test my knowledge. However, I wanted to be a little prepared. And, I follow certain thumbrules.</p>\n<p>If you are giving interview for the position of Software Engineer then study as if you are giving an interview for Senior Software Engineer. If you are looking of a Senior Software Engineer then study as if you are giving an interview for Tech Lead. So, each time you prepare for an interview we gotta target just one level higher.</p>\n<p>So, now, what could be the questions that a company could ask in a lead interview? It is very difficult to guess there are no standard questions. Having a syallbus with standard questionaires works in college. In college, we rely on the old question papers to train ourselves. But, in the industry there isn't a single answer to a problem. We will have to come up with multiple different solutions and pick the best one.</p>\n<p>So, a better way to tackle this problem would be to understand how a lead would work on a daily, monthly and a yearly bases. What exactly he does? There isn't a straight forward answers to these questions. However, below are some of the basic tasks a lead does.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Daily\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Daily\" aria-label=\"Daily permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Daily</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Help the team when they are stuck</li>\n<li>Does code review to check if the coding standards were followed</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Monthly\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Monthly\" aria-label=\"Monthly permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Monthly</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Anticipates the trouble that a developer could undergo while implementing the feature and prepares him to face the same</li>\n<li>Boosts the morale of the team by making them take individual decisions</li>\n<li>Helping team mates excel at work</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Yearly\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#Yearly\" aria-label=\"Yearly permalink\" class=\"gatsby-remark-autolink before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Yearly</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bridges the gap between his team and the managers (Both technical and people) ðŸ˜„</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In most companies a Lead does his part of coding first and then does some of the above mentioned activities. There would be additional time allocated to the lead to perform his lead activities. A lead in most cases is a person who would have stayed in that particular project ecosystem for years. He would know which source code file to check and change when there is a bug. However, a new person would take couple of hours to search and confirm the source code file. So, with these constraints it is a bit challenging to even think of (not doing) the additional task a lead does.</p>\n<p>Now, this is the challenge and we have to overcome it. And, how do we do that. In my yester years I followed one technique. We have our performance evaluations twice a year. This is a common practise across the globe. If I have worked on a complicated feature the previous week/sprint/iteration. I will check with my manager a get some light weighted work like fixing minor bugs or addressing a low priority support tickets. By doing this I would save some time only on coding and I used to extra time to do the lead activity.</p>\n<p>Lets say somebody sends a code review via a pull request to my lead. I used check that to see if all the standardizations were followed and make a note of it. And, when my lead performs his actual code review I would compare my review with his.</p>\n<p>LIke this we would need to strike a balance between work and leadership. However, this is easier said than done. And the first thing we gotta do is to start.</p>\n<p>In parallel, I also used to attend more and more interviews. The first few would be literally harassment. Now what happened in those interviews will be continued in Part 2 of this series.</p>\n<p>In part 2 we will be speaking more about SOLID principles.</p>","timeToRead":3,"id":"722d952f-aee0-53b4-8bcf-8194290cd443","frontmatter":{"date":"May 11, 2020","title":"SOLID principles for .NET interviews (Part 1)"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/solid-principles-for-net-interviews-part-1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1033876704","3435786681","550521386"]}
