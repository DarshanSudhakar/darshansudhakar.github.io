Here is a simple way to understand Git for first-timers. Learning Git is easy when Git is your first version control tool. However, for somebody who already aware of other version control tools (like SVN, Perforce, or TFS). Git will be a little challenging to understand. So, in this blog, I will suggest some tricks, tools, and tips that I used to understand Git.

## What is Git?

Is a Distributed Version Control System. In simple words you use Git to checkin code. However, you can use Git to store other digital information. Other than code I also use Git to save eBooks, Notes, PDFs, sketch notes and sometimes even data (For AI & ML)

## Why Git?

Git is famous among Open source software development community and now almost every commercial software entity uses Git. As I write this blog Micrsoft owns GitHub.

## How to use Git?

There is a common mistake that we do while learning Git. The mistake is that we start with git commands. To be frank, Git commands are great. However, it is not the best way to understand Git.

## So how do we go about learning Git

Below is the aproach that has worked for me

Things to do before you start

1. Watch highest watched video on Git for 5-10 minutes on YouTube
2. Open git [cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/){:target="_blank"}
3. Download any Git GUI client application like Fork or Sourcetree and just play with it.

This ends the basic of Git. If you are somebody who want to start a new college or personal project(s) continue reading this.

1. Here is an important step. To visualize what is happening with each command, use the repo visualization tool [Ungit](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit){:target="_blank"}. There is a nice [video](https://youtu.be/hkBVAi3oKvo){:target="_blank"}  about Ungit. Try using the commands that you have learnt here.
2. Branching is the most important concept of Git. Branching can be visualized using the branch [visualization online tool](https://learngitbranching.js.org/){:target="_blank"}. Go ahead and play here for few minutes (You may skip this if you feel you are confident of using Git)

Git packages also come with IDEs like Visual Studio or VS Code. So you can use Git directly inside these IDEs as well.

## Personal Opinion

Once you learn Git you do not feel like switching to a different source control tool. In Git branch and merging is so damn fast. Long ago when we I was using SVN we had se had a dedicated team that did branching and merging every iterations.

So enjoy your journey in the world of source control with Git!
