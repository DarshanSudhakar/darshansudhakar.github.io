## What is Git?
Is a Distributed Version Control System. In simple words you use Git to checkin code. 

## Why Git?
Git is famous among Open source software development community. Not many know that Git enjoys more than 70% market share in commercial software development market. And, once you learn Git you do not feel like switching to a different source control tool. Trust me! I know!

## How to use Git?
There is a common mistake that enthusiastics do while learning Git to start with the git commands. Git commands are great to work with Git. However, it is not the best way to understand Git. 

## So how do we go about learning Git
Below is the aproach that has worked for me
1. Watch highest watched video on Git for 5-10 minutes on YouTube
2. Open git cheat sheet [https://github.github.com/training-kit/]
3. Download any Git GUI client application like Fork or Sourcetree and just play with it. 
4. To visualize what is happening with each command, use the repo visualization tool [Ungit](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit). There is a nice [video](https://youtu.be/hkBVAi3oKvo) about Ungit. Try using the commands that you have learnt here.
5. Branching is the most important concept of Git. Branching can be visualized using the branch visualization online tool [https://learngitbranching.js.org/]. Go ahead and play here for few minutes (You may skip this if you feel you are confident of using Git)

Git packages also come with IDEs like Visual Studio or VS Code. So you can use Git directly inside these IDEs as well

So enjoy your journey in the world of source control with Git!
