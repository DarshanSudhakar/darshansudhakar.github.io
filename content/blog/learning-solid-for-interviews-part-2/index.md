Cont. from Part 1

When I started my interviews, most of my interview questions were based on SOLID principles. SOLID principles are considered important in the interviews. Why? That can be another topic for a discussion. For now, let stick on to this.

The first thing I did; was to search using search engines. The results were mostly articles in Code project and some blogs.

However, even after religiously reading this for one full day. I was not able to re-collect after a couple of weeks. Turned out that I was growing old and my memory had become more volatile.

Now, I switched to videos. Like

- SOLID principles on Youtube
- Going through some blogs and medium articles

Now I was able to remember for a month. I was proud that I was able to remember the concepts for twice the amount of time. This was turning out to be the least remembered subject in my lifetime. But why? What is making this subject so difficult to retain? It is too tough or am I studying this in a totally wrong way. It was the later that was causing trouble. It was difficult for me to retain anything that I did not practice.

There was tsunami of questions on SOLID principles

"And why am I not practicing the SOLID design principles at work"

"Am I getting adequate time to implement SOLID principles. Meh! Not sure"

"Why are we not given adequate time? Or, have we ever asked our managers to give us adequate time?"

"No. We haven't"

"And why is that?"

"Because if we fail there are grave consequences"

"And what makes us think that we are going to fail."

"I expect some unexpectedness to come up task if I try to use different technique"

"And what makes you thinks like that. Why is that you are no so confident?"

Omg! It is that lack of confidence or fear of failure that is stopping me from trying something new. Moreover, we did not have anybody to tell what kind of implementation is right and what is wrong.

Now, either were scumb to the fear or break the shakels. I chose the later.
