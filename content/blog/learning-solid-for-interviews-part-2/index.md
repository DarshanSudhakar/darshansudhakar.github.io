Cont. from Part 1

"Now that I was quite experienced it was difficult for me to retain anything that I did not practice."

"And why am I not practicing it. So why am I not implementing the SOLID design principles at work."

"Am I getting adequate time to implement SOLID principles. Meh! Not sure. I think it is. May be some of my managers do not understand how this thing works."

"Why are we not given adequate time? Or, have we ever asked our managers to give us adequate time?"

"No. We haven't."

"And why is that?"

"Because if we fail there are grave consequences."

"And what makes you think that you are going to fail."

"I expect some unexpectedness to come up task if I try to use different technique."

"And what makes you thinks like that. Why is that you are no so confident?"

Omg! It is that lack of confidence or fear of failure that is stopping me from trying something new. Moreover, we did not have anybody to tell what kind of implementation is right and what is wrong.

Now, either were break the shackels of scumb to the fear. I chose the former. Started working bravely on a library for my company implement SOLID principle
