Here we are in the middle of Covid lock downs. My work load is a little high as we do not know what future has it for us.

There is some negativity in the world but this did not deter me from following the annual ritual of not preparing for interviews. I follow this small ritual where I try to attend some interviews to test my knowledge. However, with lockdowns there is currently a shortage of interviews.

This should not deter me from studying so I told myself why not revisit SOLID principles. As I code in C# I wanted to brush my knowledge.

The first thing I did was to Google. Read some articles and felt very good.

However, I was not able to re-collect it after a couple of weeks. Why? This question triggered me  a lot. To be frank it made me a bit nervous. I knew human memory was volatile but this learning turned out to be very volatile.

I wanted an easy way to remember SOLID principles. So, I started digging materials regarding this. Like

- Watching some video on SOLID principles
- and going through Pluralsight course on these

This time I was able to remember for a month. Thats a 100% progress but it was not upto the mark. This turned out to be the least remembered subject in my entire life.

Now the question was  - "Whats making this subject so difficult to retain?". It is too tough or I am I studying this in a wrong way. There were times when I have easily managed to learn complex algorithms like the Bellmann-Ford algorithm, Merge sort etc. This were complicated in the begining however I have (or had) mastered them in many programming languages. Why is that I am failing now?

The answer to this lies in Part 2 of this continued blog post.
