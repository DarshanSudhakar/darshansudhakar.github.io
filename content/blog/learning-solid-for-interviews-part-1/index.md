This incident happened a few years ago.

There are few habits that help a lot in your career. I have one such habit of attending some interviews to test my knowledge. However, I wanted to be a little prepared.

This is how I prepare myself. If you are giving interview for the position of Software Engineer then study as if you are giving an interview for Senior Software Engineer. This time I wanted to study for a Tech Lead position.

Let me brush my knowledge on SOLID principles. It would be a great way to brush your knowledge. However, the word 'great ways' is very much debatable. And, I dont want to get into that debate.

For me SOLID principles were important. Why? Because, most of my interview questions were on SOLID principles. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

The first thing I did was to search using search engines. The results were mostly articles in Code project and some blogs.

However, even after religiously reading this for one full day. I was not able to re-collect after a couple of weeks. Turned out that I was growing old and my memory had become more volatile.

Now, I switched to videos. Like

- SOLID principles on Youtube
- Going through some blogs and medium articles

Now I was able to remember for a month. I was proud that I was able to remember the concepts for twice the amount of time. This was turning out to be the least remembered subject in my entire life.

Now the question was  - "What is making this subject so difficult to retain?". It is too tough or I am I studying this in a wrong way. There were times when I have easily managed to learn complicated algorithms at ease. So, what happened now?
