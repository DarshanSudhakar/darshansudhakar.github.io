This incident happened a few years ago.

There are few habits that help a lot in your career. I have one such habit of attending some interviews to test my knowledge. However, I wanted to be a little prepared. And, I follow certain thumbrules.

 If you are giving interview for the position of Software Engineer then study as if you are giving an interview for Senior Software Engineer. This time I wanted to study for a Lead position.

 Now, what is the top 3 things that a lead does. Let me rephrase the question. What exactly are the things my lead does?

 1. He manages the manager :smile:
 2. Does code review
 3. Identifies the problem pretty early

 And, how is he able to do all these. Because he is pretty experienced in that *particular project*.
 
 So, does this mean if you spend more time in the project you will become a better lead.

Probably, Yes... Because, the lead would have learned the entire ecosystem.

Ok, fair enough. How is that I can learn the nuances of the Tech lead without actually being in a project for so long? Moreover, when I give interviews it is always that I will not be knowing about the projects where I will work. So, I got to find a short cut.

So how do you find a shortcut?

The shortcut for examinations taken in college is by solving more and more old question papers. So at office we can use similar technique by attending more and more interviews.

Most of my interview questions were on SOLID principles. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

SOLID principles are considered important. However, the word *'important'* is very much debatable. And, I dont want to get into that debate.

The first thing I did; was to search using search engines. The results were mostly articles in Code project and some blogs.

However, even after religiously reading this for one full day. I was not able to re-collect after a couple of weeks. Turned out that I was growing old and my memory had become more volatile.

Now, I switched to videos. Like

- SOLID principles on Youtube
- Going through some blogs and medium articles

Now I was able to remember for a month. I was proud that I was able to remember the concepts for twice the amount of time. This was turning out to be the least remembered subject in my entire life.

Now the question was  - "What is making this subject so difficult to retain?". It is too tough or I am I studying this in a wrong way. There were times when I have easily managed to learn complicated algorithms at ease. So, what happened now?
